### ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Preprocessed data by handling missing values, duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Grouping, aggregating, and analyzing key trends to uncover valuable insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to communicate findings effectively.

### ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates the importance of targeted marketing strategies. By focusing on key customer segments, businesses can refine their Diwali campaigns, optimize resource allocation, and drive higher sales during the festive season.
