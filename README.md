Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project where I delved into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Diwali Sales dataset. This experience not only strengthened my skills in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, but also deepened my understanding of data analysis and storytelling through visuals.

ðŸ”‘ Key Findings:

Demographics: Married women in the 26-35 age group from Maharashtra (MH), Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Karnataka exhibited the highest spending.
Occupation Insights: High spending was observed among consumers in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation industries.
Top Products: Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most popular categories.
ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:

Data cleaning and transformation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Grouping, aggregating, and analyzing key trends
Data Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion:
This analysis highlights the importance of targeted marketing strategies. By focusing on key customer segments, businesses can enhance their Diwali campaigns and drive higher sales.
